## Solution

We've seen a subset of users report this issue.  [Version 0.11.4](https://github.com/blish-hud/Blish-HUD/releases/download/v0.11.4/Blish.HUD.0.11.4.zip) can be used until the next release which should have this resolved.

_Note: Some users report the issue suddenly resolving itself after some time allowing them to use v0.11.7 without issue._
