## Video Guide
A video guide which walks you through setting up Blish HUD for the first time: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLYYumF2SCY

## Download & Install Blish HUD

#### 1. Download Blish HUD from our release page on GitHub:
- [Latest Release](https://github.com/blish-hud/Blish-HUD/releases/latest)
- [All Releases](https://github.com/blish-hud/Blish-HUD/releases)

#### 2. Extract the ZIP to a folder.

:::tip

Ensure you have exported everything from the ZIP and not just the exe.  Blish HUD relies on content files and other dependencies to run successfully.

:::

#### 3. Launch Blish HUD.exe

The first time you launch Blish HUD, it will create `Documents\Guild Wars 2\addons\blishhud`.  Below that directory will be the important folders:

- **logs\\** — will contain any logs that Blish HUD generates (good for if there are errors you need to report).
- **modules\\** — where module files should be placed.
